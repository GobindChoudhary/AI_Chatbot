# AI Chatbot Backend

A robust, real-time AI chatbot backend leveraging Google’s Gemini API with secure authentication, memory-enabled interactions, and scalable architecture.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Node.js** & **Express** – Core server and API framework  
- **Socket.IO** – Real-time, bidirectional communication  
- **JWT** – Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens  
- **bcrypt** – Password hashing and salting for secure user credentials  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing users, sessions, and chat logs  
- **Google Gemini API** — LLM backend powering AI conversations  

---

##  Features

- **Secure Authentication**  
  - User registration and login via JWT and bcrypt  
  - Password hashing ensures sensitive data is protected  

- **Real-Time Chat Interface**  
  - Built with Socket.IO for seamless, live conversation  

- **Session Memory**  
  - Retains up to the last 20 messages per user session  
  - Maintains conversational context to enhance interaction relevance  

- **Powered by Google Gemini API**  
  - Uses Google’s advanced generative AI for intelligent responses  
  - Capability to scale across multimodal inputs and context-rich dialogue :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  Architecture Overview

```

Client ↔ \[ Express + Socket.IO Server ] ↔ MongoDB (users, sessions, chats)
↓
Google Gemini API

````

1. **Authentication & Session Management**  
   - Users register or log in via API endpoints (JWT-based)  
   - Sessions are tracked for context retention and per-message memory  

2. **Message Handling Flow**  
   - Client emits user message via Socket.IO  
   - Server retrieves up to 20 previous messages for context  
   - Sends combined prompt to Google Gemini, receives AI-generated reply  
   - Emits AI reply back to client and logs message history  

3. **Storage**  
   - MongoDB stores user data and conversation history for session persistence

##  Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GobindChoudhary/AI_Chatbot.git
   cd AI_Chatbot
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

   > You can obtain the Gemini API key from **Google AI Studio's Gemini API quickstart guide** ([Google AI for Developers][1]).

4. **Run the application**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access WebSocket endpoints** via your frontend client, or test via WebSocket tools (e.g., Postman, Insomnia).

---

## Usage

* **Register/Login** through provided REST endpoints, receiving a JWT upon success
* **Initiate chat via WebSocket** using the JWT for authentication
* The server maintains session memory of the last 20 messages to preserve conversational context
* AI responses are generated by forwarding message context to Google Gemini and relayed back in real time
